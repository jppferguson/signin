# Sign In Form Component

## Preview:
https://signin-jf.herokuapp.com/

## With more time
- Minify/Uglify HTML, CSS, JS
- More JS tests (most of `scripts/app.js` needs HTML fixtures to be able to test it)
- If you submit the form for a second time with incorrect details, shake the error message to make it more obvious.
- Animate the scrollTo for the trouble signing in jump link.
- Small bug in Safari, while the toggle button is clicked, the eye icon disappears.
- Just pushing the submit button without entering any details should display a different error message.
- More closely match material design, including ripples on button click etc.
- Cookies component at the top of the page.
- Support component at the top of the page.
